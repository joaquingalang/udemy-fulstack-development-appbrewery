        <h2>My top 3 moviles of all-time.</h2>

        <hr>

        <h3>Kimi No Nawa (2016)</h3>
        <p>This film had everything. A touching story with a brilliant twist. Don't get me started on the soundtrack. Hands down my favourite anime movie.</p>

        <h3>Sherlock Holmes (2009)</h3>
        <p>Doesn't get the attention it deserves. Mysterious, action-packed, and comical. Perfect cast.</p>

        <h3>Minecraft Movie (2025)</h3>
        <p>I... am Steve...!</p>
